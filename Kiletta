Hi! I'm Kiletta Chris!
I just started learning porgramming!
I've just learnt HTML and it's really exciting!
I'm trying to figure out how to successfully commit messages from the CLI!
I look forward to learning more and creating more interesting projects!
I'd also like to see how good I can get and in how long!
Eventually I'd like to make projects that can make a difference in not only my life but others too!
Earning while doing it would also be even better!
